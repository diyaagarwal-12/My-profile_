        <h4>Painting</h4><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cae-wp-user-uploads/app/uploads/2018/12/20100741/Rhonda-Painbrush.jpg" id="icons">

        <p id="paint">Painting has been a hobby I have embraced for quite some time. Ever since I took the paintbrush and just crafted something on paper, I have never looked back on it. Painting has been a hobby that gives me joy because I can draw my imaginations into an art piece and make the best out of it.Painting is one of those hobbies that gives me an opportunity to relax, enjoy and learn at the same time. I cannot imagine my life without colours and the essence of a painting lies in its colour schema itself.üôÇ</p>
